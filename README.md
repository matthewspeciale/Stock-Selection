# Investment-Cluster-Analysis
This project utilized business analytics on the S&P 500 combined with machine learning to generate real world business insights on investment strategies. The S&P 500 ETF Trust, also known as the SPY, is one of the most popular exchange-traded-fundâ€™s (ETF) worldwide which tracks 500 of the largest American publicly listed companies. For our project scope, we selected the companies that have been consistently in the S&P 500 from January 1st, 2006, to December 31st, 2020 (total 241 companies).  

The project is split into two phases of financial and Twitter analysis. In Phase 1, we clustered these companies with financial data derived from annual reports. Data utilized for training and validation for phase 1 contained income statements, balance sheets, earnings, and monthly adjusted price during 2006 to 2020. In phase 2, we performed sentiment analysis on tweets from Twitter to determine whether brand reputation affected the stock performance of a company. We chose Twitter as it is among the most popular social media platforms that has a consistent and engaging community discussing investments, business news, and the stock market.

Here it is displayed how cluster number 1 is significantly outperforming the S&P 500 as well as the benchmark for all 241 companies that were continuously in the S&P 500. 

Note that our model is biased because it only considers the companies that were in the S&P 500 since 2006. This was done to simplify the project. An extension of this project can take into account perhaps all companies on the stock market from 2006 - 2020.
